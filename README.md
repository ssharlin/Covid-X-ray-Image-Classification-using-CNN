# Covid-X-ray-Image-Classification-using-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network model for COVID-19 detection based on X-ray image classification 

CNN model is implemented in Keras, which is an open-source software that acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library in python for deep-learning.

The main code for the model and dataset generater is in the model_functions.py file. <br>
The model_visuals.py have the custom settings for the plots used in the Jupyter notebook.

### Dataset:
